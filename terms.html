                    CONTENT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Licensee is solely responsible for Licensee's use of the Content. Licensee may only use the Content responsibly, in a manner consistent with the exercise of good judgment. If Licensee is having difficulty deciding whether Licensee's intended use is appropriate, or whether Licensee needs written permission, or whether other legal issues should be considered, Y4U strongly encourages Licensee to seek competent legal counsel. Y4U will not assist Licensee in making this determination, nor can Y4U provide Licensee with legal advice as to intellectual property rights. If Licensee or Licensee's legal advisor determines that Licensee is required by law to obtain written permission to use portions of the Content, Licensee must request permission for reproduction, redistribution, or modification of the Content from the appropriate owner of the subject materials (as may be cited in the Licensed Software). If, on the other hand, Licensee or Licensee's legal advisor determines it is permissible to proceed and include Content from the Licensed Software, Y4U asks Licensee to correctly designate Y4U trademark(s) when referring to the Licensed software in the notice or copyright portion of Licensee's paper, project, or product. Licensee shall indemnity, hold harmless, and defend Y4U, its officers, directors and shareholders, and Y4U suppliers from all claims, damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and lawsuits that arise from, or result from, Licensee's use or distribution of Content.

Any Update provided to Licensee is made on a License exchange basis such that Licensee agrees, as a condition for receiving an Update, that Licensee will terminate all of Licensee's rights to use any previous version of the Licensed Software. However, Licensee may continue to use the previous version only to assist in transitioning to the Updated version. Once an Update has been released, Y4U may cease support for prior versions, without any notice to Licensee.

                <h2>ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BETA SOFTWARE</h2>
                <p>If the Licensed Software that Licensee receives with this EULA is pre-commercial release or “BETA” software (“Pre-release Software”), then, to the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this EULA, this section supersedes such conflicting term(s) and condition(s) as to the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. Licensee acknowledges that the Pre-release Software does not represent the final product from Y4U, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, Y4U disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to Licensee of any kind whatsoever. IN APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT MAY BE LIMITED, Y4U LIABILITY, AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50.00). Licensee acknowledges that Y4U has not promised or guaranteed to Licensee that the Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, and that Y4U has no express or implied obligation to Licensee to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software. Y4U may decide not to introduce a product similar to, or compatible with, the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that any research or development that Licensee performs regarding the Pre-release Software, or any product associated with the Pre-release Software, is done entirely at Licensee's own risk. During the term of this EULA, if requested by Y4U, Licensee will provide feedback to Y4U regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports. If Licensee has been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, then Licensee's use of the Pre-release Software is also governed by that agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this EULA to the contrary, if Licensee is located outside of Canada Licensee will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software within 30 days of the completion of Licensee's testing of the Pre-release Software if that date is earlier than the date scheduled for Y4U first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial) Software.
